        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
        Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is used to make computers learn over experience with data rather than explicitly instructing behavior through programming. Main prerequisite of this application is data. The main aim is to make computers learn automatically through data that it encounters without human intervention. Machine learning helps analyze large sets of data and provides more accurate analysis results. However, resources required to achieve this might increase with size of data.

      <h2>Types of Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
      <div class="typesContainer">
        <div class="supervised">
          <h3>Supervised Machine Learning</h3>
          These algorithms are trained with known datasets. The knowledge gained from processing theses datasets are applied to new labelled data sets as a learning mechanism to predict outputs. These outputs can in turn can be checked with intended results to make the program learn about errors that it caused thereby helping it improvise.
        </div>
        <div class="unsupervised">
          <h3>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h3>
          These algorithms are used on data sets that are not classified or labelled to deduce hidden patterns in data. These algorithms are not used to figure out correct results but rather to explore large data sets of data and draw inferences.

        <div class="semi">
          <h3>Semi Supervised Machine Learning</h3>
          In this method, systems are provided with labelled and unlabeled data sets. A small amount of labeled data sets and a large amount of unlabeled data sets are provided typically. These systems are predicted to have increased accuracy over time.

        <div class="reinf">
          <h3>Reinforcement Machine Learning</h3>
          These algorithms work on a trial and error pattern. It interacts with the environment by producing actions and learns from the outcomes of these outcomes. A reinforcement signal is provided to the system on approaching an intended result which helps it understand when it has performed an action appropriately.

          <h3>Traffic Predictions</h3>
          We all use GPS while travelling. GPS provides us a route to our destination at the same time determines traffic at certain routes by using GPS data from all vehicles on respective routes. However, not all vehicles are equipped with GPS. In order to face this issue, machine learning is used to predict traffic at certain routes with available data.
