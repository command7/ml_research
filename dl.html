        Deep learning is an advanced method of implementing machine learning. The system is designed quite similar to the biological human brain. Unlike human brain in which any neuron can connect to any neuron within a distance, neural networks within deep learning have several layers. Each layer processes a part of the data and forwards it to the next layer. For example, when a stop sign is processed by a deep learning algorithm to determine if it’s a stop sign, the stop sign is broken down into several parts such as the octagonal shape, the color, the text etc. and each broken part is processed by a layer of neural network to produce a prediction percentage of whether it’s a stop sign. However, predictions might go wrong due to other factors in the image such as brightness, darkness, fog, mist etc., This process is resource intensive and was considered a waste of resources at the start of this technology but after the evolution of GPUs, it has become much easier. Now, deep learning algorithms can be trained with data sets to improve accuracy in prediction. Considering the stop sign example, several million images of stop signs can be fed to these algorithms to learn over time about the errors made by them and improvise prediction.
