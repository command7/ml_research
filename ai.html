        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        Artificial Intelligence is a term used to denote simulated machines that are programmed to think like a human. The program contains a long list of if and else conditions to execute appropriate actions. They do not learn over time. These systems can do only what they are programmed to do. The process of programming and artificial intelligence system requires considering scenarios that you want the system to handle and programming it to consider a variety of conditions in the scenario to deliver an intended output. These days a lot of chat bot systems are driven by artificial Intelligence where they respond to you based on your input. They are programmed to respond in a particular way to particular texts. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding artificial intelligence systems as people fear they might become too intelligent to take off on their own. Artificial Intelligence has found its way into several other applications such self driving cars. Self driving cars are still not trusted by humans as they do not take into account human error. They are programmed to minimize damage which might not take into factor humans and the damage it might cause to them during the process. As Artificial Intelligence has advanced, it has led to machine learning which paved path for these artificial intelligence systems to learn over time using data that it encounters.
