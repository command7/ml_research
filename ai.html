        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        Artificial Intelligence is a term used to denote simulated machines that are programmed to think like a human. The program contains a long list of if and else conditions to execute appropriate actions. They do not learn over time. These systems can do only what they are programmed to do. The process of programming and artificial intelligence system requires considering scenarios that you want the system to handle and programming it to consider a variety of conditions in the scenario to deliver an intended output. These days a lot of chat bot systems are driven by artificial Intelligence where they respond to you based on your input. They are programmed to respond in a particular way to particular texts. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding artificial intelligence systems as people fear they might become too intelligent to take off on their own. Artificial Intelligence has found its way into several other applications such self driving cars. Self driving cars are still not trusted by humans as they do not take into account human error. They are programmed to minimize damage which might not take into factor humans and the damage it might cause to them during the process. As Artificial Intelligence has advanced, it has lead to machine learning which paved path for these artificial intelligence systems to learn over time using data that it encounters.

        <h2>Self Driving Cars</h2>
        The first automated car was developed in 1977 by Japan’s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. The technology behind automated cars involves several sensors such as radars, computer vision, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. These sensors produce data when they produce signals. These data are processed by artificial intelligence systems incorporated into a vehicle to predict its surroundings. Based on these predictions these cars operate thereby trying to avoid obstacles and follow lanes. Since these are just predictions based on data, there are controversies surrounding this concept whether to trust it with human life. However, in today’s world with the massive amounts of data available at disposal, these predictions are becoming more and more accurate.

        <h2>Optimal Character Recognition</h2>
        Optimal character recognition is the technology used to convert digital images to editable documents. It is capable of converting books containing thousands of pages into a pdf or word documents. When physical documents are scanned using a scanner, it does not provide you with the ability of editing and adding content to it. The scanner only provides an image of the documents containing several lines of black and white dots which is called a raster image. OCR softwares are used to convert these raster images digitally by singling out these black and white dots into letters, then into words and then into lines of text. During the processing of singling out text characters, these characters are converted into ASCII code for computers to understand and thereby making it easier to recreate the document into a digital format.
