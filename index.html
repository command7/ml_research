        In today's world, there is huge fear surfacing around people about the influence of robots and automated processing in the future. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are playing a huge role in today's development. The level of advancement and acheivement in these fields have been tremendous making us wonder and feel proud about the capability of human brains and inventions and at the same time there also lies a question if we humans are digging our own grave due to our laziness and greed for innovation. Human jobs are at stake because of this. Machine Learning is being used in trading to predict stock ranges and make decision in investments accordingly. Recently artificial intelligent systems have also made their debut into medical industry where a robot was made to perform surgical operations. There is also a huge sense of worrying about whether robots will eventually have the abiblity to think and make decisions on their own without human interruption. There were several movies taken about the rise of robots as a seperate being in this planet. How does Artificial intelligence and machine learning work? What do they revolve around? Will human jobs be at stake?
        <p>The video below explains about the differences between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning and how they work.</p>
